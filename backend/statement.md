1. Problem Statement (you can copy–adapt this)

People often waste time deciding which movie to watch because of too many choices across platforms. The goal of this project is to build an AI-based movie recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their interests and viewing history.

2. Objectives

Build a system that recommends movies to a user.

Use AI/ML techniques for similarity and recommendations.

Provide at least two types of recommendations:

Content-based (similar movies to a given movie)

User-based (optional: based on ratings/likes)

Design it with clear input/output and workflow so a normal user can use it.

3. Functional Modules (3 Major Modules)

You can use these in your report:

Data Processing Module

Load dataset

Clean data (handle missing values)

Feature extraction (genres, tags, etc.)

Recommendation Engine Module

Content-based recommendation using cosine similarity

(Optional) Collaborative filtering / rating-based suggestions

User Interaction Module

User selects a movie / types preferences

System shows top N recommended movies

4. Non-Functional Requirements (mention at least 4)

Examples:

Performance: System must return recommendations within 2 seconds for typical queries.

Usability: Simple CLI or web interface for selecting movies.

Maintainability: Code organized in modules/files, easy to extend.

Reliability: Handles invalid movie names without crashing.

Scalability (basic): Design should allow using a larger dataset in the future.

You can adjust wording later.
